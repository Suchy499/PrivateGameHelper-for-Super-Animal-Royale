Tired of typing out each command by hand in your custom games?
This tool lets you input every in-game command with a click of a button!

## Download / Installation

### Method #1

- Download the archive from [GitHub](https://github.com/Suchy499/PrivateGameHelper-for-Super-Animal-Royale/releases/latest)
- Extract the downloaded zip file
- In the extracted folder, run the `Private Game Helper.exe` file

### Method #2

- Install Python and pip
- Clone (or download) the repo:  
  `git clone https://github.com/Suchy499/PrivateGameHelper-for-Super-Animal-Royale.git`
- Navigate to repo's directory:  
  `cd PrivateGameHelper-for-Super-Animal-Royale`
- Install the requirements:  
  `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the `__main__.py` file

## Key Features

- Easy access to all in-game commands
- Saving/loading custom presets
- Spawning in-game items
- Copying map coordinates to clipboard
- Instantly teleporting players
- Custom game modes

## Notes

- Currently only works on Windows
- Apply settings only once per custom lobby
- Do not press any keys after using a button that changes in-game setting until the program has finished doing so
- Have your in-game chat closed before using the program
- Setting up dodgeball ziplines might not work properly if your display isn't using the 16:9 aspect ratio,
the solution to that is changing your in-game resolution to one that's 16:9 (e.g. 1920x1080, 1280x720) and running the game in windowed mode

## Changelog

### v1.4.2

- Removed the super juicer
- Added the /ziplines command
- Fixed zipline placement for dodgeball and hamball racing
